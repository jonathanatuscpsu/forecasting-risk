Welcome to Forecasting and Risk (BANA 4090)! The main objective of this course is to provide you with the proper foundation to analyze and forecast time series data in the professional setting. This means that in addition to forecasting into the future and evaluating such forecasts we will discuss other topics to prepare you for your journey as an analyst. While covering core concepts like univariate and multivariate forecasting/evaluation of forecasts are critical, I believe we should also cover topics like approaching a forecasting a problem, wrangling with time series data/objects, advanced topics like neural networks for time series, hierarchical data and practical issues when approaching a problem and implementing a solution.  

While I will try to focus on the application over the theory to maximize the above objectives, I will provide additional optional reading for those interested in a deeper dive into the theory ðŸš€.

## Description of Major Assignments
 
 - **Exam**  â€“ There will be one exam given during class (~half of class) after we finish module 3 to assess grasp of key concepts of time series analysis and forecasting.
 
 - **Assignments**  â€“ 5 take-home assignments will be given throughout the semester. Students will have 2 weeks to complete the assignments. 
 
 - **Discussions**  â€“ The first 14 classes will have in-class labs/discussions. Write-ups from these discussions/labs are to be submitted on Canvas by 11:59pm on the   Sunday after class. If you cannot make the class, these will be posted and submission will be allowed.
 
 - **Project**  â€“ The project is a core component of this course. Students will pick a topic and dataset of their choosing to analyze and forecast with the methods taught in this course (and ideally some additional methods). These topics will be submitted in March and the analyses will be presented during week 15. In lieu of a final exam, students will submit a reproducible markdown/notebook.
